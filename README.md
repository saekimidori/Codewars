My solutions to all the kata I have successfully solved.

Highly recommended that you have spent at least a good 20 minutes trying to figure out the answers yourself before looking at the solutions.

Currently transferring each solution to their own js file because that seems to be the best thing to do.

If you're trying to look for a specific solution, use <code>CTRL + F</code> (if on Windows).

<code>testing.js</code> is used for me to run test solutions. You may see many failed attempts there... Ignore them.
