// Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

// All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

const minMax = arr =>
  // takes an array
  // return min and max num in an array
  
  // Math.min/max(...arr)
  [Math.min(...arr), Math.max(...arr)]
