// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

// 1. number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
// 2. distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
// 3. width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

function pillars(num_pill, dist, width) {
    if (num_pill > 1) {
      return ((num_pill-2)*width) + ((dist*100)*(num_pill-1))
    } else {
      return 0
    }
